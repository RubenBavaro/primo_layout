        Millions experienced severe disruption as record-breaking winds
        <br>
        from Storm Eunice caused death and injury, huge structural 
        <br>
        damage, transport chaos and widespread power cuts.
        <br><br>
        Four people were confirmed to have died in the UK and Ireland by 
        <br>
        Friday evening. The Met Office said a wind speed of up to 122mph 
        <br>
        was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Friday,
        <br>
        provisionally the highest ever in England, and described the 
        <br>
        storm as the worst since the Burn’s Day storm 32 years ago in 
        <br>
        which 47 people died.
        <br><br>
        About a third of the UK population – about 20 million people – 
        <br>
        were told to stay at home as the Met Office imposed two rare red 
        <br>
        warnings for much of southern England, south Wales and London.
        <br><br>
        The disruption closed thousands of schools and businesses. About 
        <br>
        435,000 homes were left without power early on Friday evening. 
        <br>
        Hundreds of train services and flights were cancelled, and major 
        <br>
        roads closed.
